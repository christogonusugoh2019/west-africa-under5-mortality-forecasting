# Forecasting Under-Five Mortality in West Africa: A Multi-Model Time Series Analysis
This repository contains the code and data for our research project on forecasting under-five mortality in West Africa using a multi-model time series analysis approach.
# Project Overvie
This research project aims to develop and evaluate a multi-model time series analysis framework for forecasting under-five mortality rates in West Africa. The project combines traditional time series methods with machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of mortality rate forecasts. The goal is to provide policymakers and healthcare professionals with reliable and actionable forecasts to inform decision-making and resource allocation.
# Research Objectives
1. Develop a multi-model time series analysis framework for forecasting under-five mortality rates in West Africa.
2. Evaluate the performance of traditional time series methods and machine learning techniques in forecasting under-five mortality rates.
3. Compare the accuracy of different models and identify the best-performing model.
4. Provide actionable forecasts and insights to inform healthcare policy and decision-making.
